A school project with an attempt to predict seizures. Developed with Julius.ai. Uses Random Forest. script2.py is the main file (well, hopefully it works (fingers crossed)).

In practice, this model would work best with a general algorithm that adapts to patients as time and number of observed seizures increases, as accuracy vastly changed from training to tested model with patient 02.
